## Overview

This guide covers the implementation of intelligent tutoring systems in STEM education, focusing on three case studies:

* **ALEKS** for mathematics tutoring
* **PhysicsAssistant** for interactive physics labs
* **Inq-ITS** for scaffolding data interpretation in scientific inquiry

Each section provides links, technical resources, and practical suggestions for integrating these tools into your curriculum or research.

## Required Resources

### ALEKS

* **Platform Access:** [ALEKS Official Site](https://www.aleks.com)
* **Devices:** Computer or tablet with internet access
* **Account:** Student or instructor ALEKS accounts (usually institution-provided)
* **Getting Started Guide:** [ALEKS Support & Resources](https://www.aleks.com/support)
* **Sample Activities:**

  * Initial diagnostic assessment
  * Personalized learning modules

---

### PhysicsAssistant

> **Note:** PhysicsAssistant is a research prototype. Full public deployments may require collaboration or custom development. Below are the technical resources for implementing similar activities.

* **Hardware:**

  * Computer or Raspberry Pi
  * Webcam/camera
  * Microphone & speakers
  * Optionally, a robotic platform (e.g., Arduino, Jetson Nano for more advanced builds)

* **Software:**

  * [YOLOv8 Object Detection](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics) (for visual analysis)
  * [OpenAI GPT-3.5-turbo API](https://platform.openai.com/) (for language processing)
  * [Speech Recognition Libraries](https://pypi.org/project/SpeechRecognition/) (Python)
  * Python, OpenCV, and supporting libraries

* **Sample Datasets:**

  * Physics lab data (e.g., projectile motion measurements)

* **Sample Implementation:**

  * [PhysicsAssistant arXiv Preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.18721)
  * [OpenAI API Documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt)

### Inq-ITS

* **Platform Access:** [Inq-ITS Official Site](https://www.inqits.com/)
* **Devices:** Web-enabled devices
* **Accounts:** Teacher/classroom setup typically required
* **Example Activities:** Virtual labs, inquiry-based simulations, collaborative data analysis

---

### General Tools & Platforms

* **Virtual Labs:** [Labster](https://www.labster.com/)
* **Gamified Learning:** [Duolingo](https://www.duolingo.com/) (for examples of gamification)

---

## Activity Instructions

### ALEKS Activities

**Activity 1: Diagnostic Assessment and Personalized Practice**

* Guide students to log in to ALEKS and complete the initial diagnostic.
* Assign modules for personalized practice.
* Use ALEKS analytics to monitor student progress and adapt instruction.

**Activity 2: Peer Teaching Challenge**

* After topic mastery, have students use ALEKS tools to explain concepts to peers.
* Facilitate group discussions and encourage collaborative problem solving.

---

### PhysicsAssistant Activities

**Activity 1: Guided Lab Investigations**

* Set up the PhysicsAssistant (or similar setup with camera/microphone).
* Have students conduct experiments (e.g., projectile motion) while interacting with the assistant for guidance and feedback.
* Use object detection and speech recognition to answer student queries in real-time.

**Activity 2: Design Your Experiment**

* Challenge students to plan and execute their own experiments.
* The assistant guides hypothesis formulation, data collection, and analysis.
* Students present findings, supported by feedback from the system.

**Note:** If PhysicsAssistant is not available, educators can simulate these activities using Python scripts, YOLOv8, and OpenAI’s GPT APIs.

---

### Inq-ITS Activities

**Activity 1: Simulated Scientific Inquiry**

* Assign students to use Inq-ITS for virtual labs.
* Students collect data, analyze results, and receive real-time scaffolding from the system.

**Activity 2: Collaborative Data Analysis**

* Group students to analyze and synthesize datasets using Inq-ITS.
* Encourage presentation of findings using the system’s visualization tools.

---

## Ethical and Privacy Considerations

* Ensure **student data privacy** by following institutional and legal guidelines.
* Inform students and guardians about data collection and AI system use.
* Implement safeguards for ethical use of AI (refer to [Ethical Principles for AI in Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.15296)).
* Regularly review system fairness and inclusivity.
