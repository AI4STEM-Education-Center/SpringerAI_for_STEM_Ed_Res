Case 3: Chauhan et al. (2025) prompt: scenario-based multiple-choice question 


“Please develop a scenario-based multiple-choice question designed to evaluate a first-year medical student's understanding of medical physiology, focusing on the [specific topic]. 
The scenario should reflect a realistic situation relevant to the regional context of [India]. Ensure that the question follows the guidelines for framing the single best scenario based on multiple-choice question.
Ensure the stem of scenario based multiple choice question should be concise, focused, and provide all necessary information without extraneous details suited to first-year medical students. 
Include the full form of any abbreviations and the normal range for any laboratory tests mentioned in the scenario.
The lead-in should be focused on a single themed and unambiguous, ensuring that the student knows exactly what they are being asked. 
Each scenario based multiple-choice question should have 4-option with a single best answer. Ensure that answer choices do not directly oppose each other. 
Each option should be distinct but plausible. 
The question should be of a moderate difficulty for testing the student's ability to apply and analyze their knowledge effectively. Provide the correct answer with an explanation at the end of the question for reference."

An adaptable Version for use. 
Component 1: Task Definition and Scope
•	Original: “develop a scenario-based multiple-choice question designed to evaluate a first-year medical student’s understanding”
•	Adaptation Strategy: Modify the educational level (first-year, advanced, graduate) and subject area (physiology, pharmacology, pathology) based on your specific needs
•	Example Adaptation: “develop a case-based multiple-choice question designed to evaluate a third-year medical student's understanding of clinical pharmacology”
Component 2: Content Specificity
•	Original: “focusing on the [specific topic]”
•	Adaptation Strategy: Replace with your target topic, being as specific as possible
•	Examples: 
o	“focusing on cardiac arrhythmias and their electrocardiographic manifestations”
o	“focusing on respiratory physiology in high-altitude environments”
o	“focusing on endocrine disorders in pregnancy”
Component 3: Contextual Relevance
•	Original: “relevant to the regional context of [India]”
•	Adaptation Strategy: Specify your geographic or cultural context to ensure appropriate scenarios
•	Examples: 
o	“Relevant to the healthcare context of rural sub-Saharan Africa”
o	“Relevant to urban emergency medicine in North America”
o	“Relevant to tropical medicine practice in Southeast Asia”
Component 4: Technical Specifications
•	Original: "Include the full form of any abbreviations and the normal range for any laboratory tests"
•	Adaptation Strategy: Add specific technical requirements based on your assessment needs
•	Extensions: 
o	“Include relevant diagnostic imaging findings where appropriate”
o	“Incorporate current clinical guidelines and evidence-based recommendations”
o	“Ensure all drug dosages and treatment protocols are current and accurate”
Component 5: Structural Requirements
•	Original: “4-option with a single best answer”
•	Adaptation Strategy: Modify based on your preferred question format
•	Alternatives: 
o	“5-option with a single best answer for increased difficulty”
o	“True/False format with detailed justification”
o	“Multiple response format where more than one option may be correct”
